# DriverDAO# 🚗 DriverDAO: Fair Wage Advocacy on Blockchain

Welcome to DriverDAO, the decentralized autonomous organization empowering gig economy drivers to unite, vote on fair wage policies, and enforce collective bargaining rights using the Stacks blockchain. Say goodbye to exploitative platforms—drivers now control their destiny with transparent, token-governed decisions.

## ✨ Features

🗳️ Token-weighted voting on wage proposals (e.g., minimum per-mile rates)
💼 Membership tokens earned via verified driving hours or contributions
📊 Real-time proposal tracking and quorum enforcement
🔒 Secure multisig treasury for union funds and legal fees
📈 Incentive rewards for active voters and proposal creators
⚖️ Dispute resolution via on-chain arbitration
🏛️ Transparent governance logs for all decisions

## 🛠 How It Works

**For Drivers (Members)**

- Mint membership tokens by submitting proof of driving (e.g., hashed mileage logs)
- Propose wage policies like "Raise surge pricing minimum to $2/mile" with a small token stake
- Vote on active proposals using your token balance—quorum requires 51% participation

Your voice counts proportionally to your stake and activity!

**For Verifiers & Admins**

- Use query-proposals to review open votes and historical outcomes
- Call execute-policy to auto-enforce passed proposals (e.g., via API integrations with ride platforms)
- Resolve disputes with on-chain votes or oracle-fed evidence

Decisions are binding, auditable, and unstoppable.

## 🔗 Smart Contracts (Clarity on Stacks)

This DAO leverages 8 interconnected Clarity smart contracts for robust, gas-efficient governance:

1. **membership-token.clar** - ERC-20-like token minting and burning for driver membership.
2. **proposal-factory.clar** - Creates and categorizes new wage policy proposals.
3. **voting-mechanism.clar** - Handles token-weighted votes with quorum and timelocks.
4. **treasury-vault.clar** - Multisig wallet for holding union funds and disbursing rewards.
5. **incentive-distributor.clar** - Rewards voters and creators with bonus tokens.
6. **dispute-arbitrator.clar** - On-chain resolution for vote challenges or policy disputes.
7. **policy-executor.clar** - Automates enforcement of passed policies via external calls.
